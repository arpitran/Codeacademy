## Visualizing World Cup Data With Seaborn

A little primer on the Fifa World Cup: The FIFA World Cup, or simply the World Cup, is an international f√∫tbol competition where 32 countries qualify to send teams made up of the best players from that nation to compete against each other for the World Cup championship.

The World Cup championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.

The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of one month.
